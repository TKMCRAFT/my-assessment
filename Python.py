"""
To answer the following questions, make use of datasets: 
    'scheduled_loan_repayments.csv'
    'actual_loan_repayments.csv'
These files are located in the 'data' folder. 

'scheduled_loan_repayments.csv' contains the expected monthly payments for each loan. These values are constant regardless of what is actually paid.
'actual_loan_repayments.csv' contains the actual amount paid to each loan for each month.

All loans have a loan term of 2 years with an annual interest rate of 10%. Repayments are scheduled monthly.
A type 1 default occurs on a loan when any scheduled monthly repayment is not met in full.
A type 2 default occurs on a loan when more than 15% of the expected total payments are unpaid for the year.

Note: Do not round any final answers.
